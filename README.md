The Oracle Journey has been an interesting series of events in my career. Oracle had a healthcare IT division earlier known as Cerner Healthcare which is now acquired. Within the Division, I was part of the Upgrade Center which mainly deals with EMR/EHR software upgrades for hospitals worldwide.
  I had started out with a Project Delivery Consultant â€“ Consultant acting as a solution expert connecting with clients and gaining their requirements for the project and providing insights for a specific solution. Soon after my experience with many clients, I was promoted as a Project Coordinator in the US team â€“ Coordinating activities and perform consulting operations in the organization with clients.
